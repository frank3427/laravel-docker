# Security HTTP Headers
#######################

# HSTS is used to force browsers to only connect using HTTPS.
# Declare that a website is only accessible over a secure connection (HTTPS).
#
# Force client-side SSL redirection.
#
# If a user types `example.com` in their browser, even if the server
# redirects them to the secure version of the website, that still leaves
# a window of opportunity (the initial HTTP connection) for an attacker
# to downgrade or redirect the request.
#
# The following header ensures that browser will ONLY connect to your
# server via HTTPS, regardless of what the users type in the browser's
# address bar.
#
# The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP.
# HSTS (ngx_http_headers_module is required) (15768000 seconds = 6 months)
# test: https://hstspreload.org/
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "@HSTS_HEADER@" always;

# An HTTP header which indicates whether the browser should allow the webpage to be displayed in a frame within another webpage.
# Used as a defense against clickjacking attacks.
#
# Config to don't allow the browser to render the page inside an frame or iframe and avoid clickjacking http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking
#
# If you need to allow [i]frames, you can use SAMEORIGIN or even set an uri with ALLOW-FROM uri.
add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN always;

# Prevent some browsers from MIME-sniffing the response.
# When serving user-supplied content, include a X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header along with the Content-Type: header, to disable content-type sniffing on some browsers.
#
# O header de resposta HTTP X-Content-Type-Options é um marcador usado pelo servidor para indicar que os MIME types enviados pelos headers Content-Type não devem ser alterados e seguidos.
# Isto permite que o usuário opte por não participar do chamado MIME Type Sniffing ou, em outras palavras, é uma forma de dizer que os webmasters estão vendo o que você está fazendo.
#
# note: nosniff só se aplica para tipos "script" e "style".
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff always;

# The HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
# Although these protections are largely unnecessary in modern browsers when sites implement a strong Content-Security-Policy that disables the use of inline JavaScript ('unsafe-inline'), they can still provide protections for users of older web browsers that don't yet support CSP.
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;

# Mitigate cross-site scripting attacks by whitelisting allowed sources of script, style, and other resources.
#
# This can be done by setting a `Content Security Policy` which whitelists trusted sources of content for your website.
#
# Prevent XSS, clickjacking, code injection attacks by implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) header in your web page HTTP response.
# CSP instruct browser to load allowed content to load on the website.
#
# To make things easier, you can use an online CSP header generator
# such as: https://www.cspisawesome.com/

# A web application uses HTTPS and a URL-based session identifier.

# Enabling Public Key Pinning Extension for HTTP (HPKP).
# The Public Key Pinning Extension for HTML5 (HPKP) is a security feature that tells a web client to associate a specific cryptographic public key with a certain web server to decrease the risk of MITM attacks with forged certificates.
#
# Declare that a website's HTTPS certificate should only be treated as valid if the public key is contained in a specified list to prevent MITM attacks that use valid CA-issued certificates.
#
# The HPKP header provides a web browser a way to confirm that the certificate presented by a domain is one that the domain issued.
# It’s a defense against man-in-the-middle attacks targeting SSL certificates, uncovering proxies that rewrite SSL traffic.
# It’s also a protection against rogue certificates that could be issued for any number of nefarious purposes.
#
# note: Only valid on SSL version of domain.
